# Ranking Queue Rules

## General Rules

*Until further notice the new map format will be unrankable. This will stay in place until we have adjusted the criteria and made/updated tools for the new format.*
- Maps must not break 350 BPM sustained
- Maps must not break 15* difficulty
- Maps must not break 14* difficulty without a QAT upvote on all ranked difficulties and receive 2/3 approval by RT and QAT
- Current soft limit for map length is 10 minutes
- Queue limit of 4 maps per mapper*
  - difficulties with multiple mappers count towards the limit for each mapper.
  - Downmaps, difficulties not going for rank, and lighting do not count towards this limit.

> *If you currently have more than 4 maps in queue you will have to wait till you have less than 4 to get anymore maps queued


| ðŸ’¡ | *Additional difficulties at or above the highest difficulty in the initial ranking request cannot be added to the request beyond two weeks from the initial request date without resetting to the bottom of the queue* |
